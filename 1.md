# JavaScript Constructors and Prototypes - Practice Tasks

## Task 1: Basic Constructor Function

Create a constructor function called `Car` that takes two parameters: `brand` and `model`. The constructor should set these as properties on the created object using the `this` keyword.

Example usage:

```javascript
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
console.log(myCar.brand); // "Toyota"
console.log(myCar.model); // "Corolla"
```

## Task 2: Adding Methods to Prototype

Using the `Car` constructor from Task 1, add a method called `getInfo` to the Car prototype. This method should return a string in the format: "Brand: [brand], Model: [model]"

## Task 3: Understanding 'this' Context

Create a constructor function called `Counter` that initializes a `count` property to 0. Add two methods to its prototype:

- `increment()` - increases count by 1
- `getCount()` - returns the current count

Make sure both methods use `this` to access the count property.

## Task 4: Using Object.getPrototypeOf()

Create an object using your `Car` constructor from Task 1. Then use `Object.getPrototypeOf()` to get the prototype of your car object and log it to the console. Also check if this prototype is the same as `Car.prototype`.

## Task 5: Exploring Prototype Chain

Create a simple object literal called `vehicle` with a property `wheels: 4`. Then create a `Car` constructor and use `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to set the `vehicle` object as the prototype of `Car.prototype`. Create a car instance and verify that it can access the `wheels` property.

## Task 6: Custom Prototype Method

Create a constructor function called `Rectangle` that takes `width` and `height` parameters. Add a method called `getArea` to the Rectangle prototype that calculates and returns the area (width Ã— height).

## Task 7: Prototype Inheritance Chain

Create two constructor functions:

1. `Animal` - takes a `name` parameter
2. `Dog` - takes `name` and `breed` parameters

Use `Object.setPrototypeOf()` to make `Dog.prototype` inherit from `Animal.prototype`. Add a `speak` method to Animal prototype that returns "Animal makes a sound" and override it in Dog prototype to return "[name] barks!".

## Task 8: Checking Prototype Relationships

Using the constructors from Task 7, create a dog instance. Then use various methods to check:

- What is the prototype of your dog instance? (use `Object.getPrototypeOf()`)
- Is your dog instance an instance of Dog? (use `instanceof`)
- Is your dog instance an instance of Animal? (use `instanceof`)

## Task 9: Dynamic Prototype Modification

Create a `Person` constructor that takes a `name` parameter. Create two person instances. Then, after creating the instances, add a new method called `greet` to the Person prototype that returns "Hello, I'm [name]". Verify that both existing instances can now use this new method.

## Task 10: Constructor with Validation

Create a constructor function called `BankAccount` that takes an initial `balance` parameter. Add validation in the constructor to ensure the balance is not negative (if it is, set it to 0). Add these methods to the prototype:

- `deposit(amount)` - adds money to balance (only if amount is positive)
- `withdraw(amount)` - subtracts money from balance (only if there are sufficient funds)
- `getBalance()` - returns current balance

Make sure all methods use `this` appropriately and include basic validation.

## Instructions

- Complete each task in the `script.js` file
- Test your solutions with console.log statements
- Focus on understanding how `this`, prototypes, and constructors work together
- Each task builds on concepts from previous tasks
- Take your time to understand each concept before moving to the next task
